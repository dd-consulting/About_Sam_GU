For the infographic:

Design: Use a professional color scheme aligned with your brand or NTU's colors. Highlight the most important points about your skills and experience.
Icons and Stats: Include visuals like AI symbols, academic caps, or GitHub logos to visually differentiate your key domains (AI, Data Science, etc.).

Flow: Ensure it’s digestible at a glance. Top part includes your name and tagline, followed by your core areas of expertise, and ends with highlights from your professional experience and GitHub contributions.

By implementing these adjustments, your webpage will serve as an effective professional showcase, positioning you well for academic and consulting opportunities.
